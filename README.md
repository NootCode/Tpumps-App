Tpumps Mobile App

Mobile Application using flutter and dart. This app was made to improve customer experience at tpumps boba shops. Allows users to discover new drinks, create better flavor combinations and save them to try for later. The users can also find different locations of the stores and get directions to each location.

Currently all features are functional except the Drink of the Day on the home screen. Needs to be implemented so every day at midnight a new drink is selected.

Future updates!

In the future I plan to make a community page that allows users to post their favorite drinks for others to see. Other users can like the drinks allowing others to sort by the number of likes each drink has. Can also make a chat function allowing customers to chat amongst eachother to promote a more social environment bringing more business to the company. 

Overall this project was really fun to work with!
